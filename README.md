# MicroJPA

MicroJPA is a framework to provide injection of resource-local ``EntityManager``s and their factories via ``@PersistenceContext`` and ``@PersistenceUnit`` in CDI-environments where no such injection is present.
That may be the case in testing scenarios or with servers that do not implement the full JEE stack like [Meecrowave](https://openwebbeans.apache.org/meecrowave/).
